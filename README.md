# Pokemon-battle-C-ASM
A Pokemon battle game written in C and Assembly language without external libraries, designed to run on the ARM-based MD407 primitive computer developed at Chalmers. It was initially created during the DAT390 "Machine-oriented programming" course.

## Features

- **Hardware Driver Development**: We've written custom drivers to handle interactions with the MD407's display and keypad components.
- **Game Logic**: The core of the game, including battle mechanics and player interactions, has been crafted with attention to detail in C.
- **Pixel Art Creation**: All visual elements have been handcrafted pixel by pixel to bring the classic Pokemon aesthetic to life on the MD407.
- **Team Collaboration**: This project was brought to fruition through the concerted efforts of a dedicated three-person team, highlighting our project management and teamwork skills.
